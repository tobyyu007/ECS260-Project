Route Guard is a mechanism to have more control over the routes that are available throughout your app. These can be simple menu permissions that work with activation or deactivation of the route.

One example is your app is used to manage the transfer of finances where the normal user can request different financial services and the admin can approve that.  For this, to hide and control the listing of all the requests received, we have to restrict the route to only the admin user and no one else should be able to access that route.",https://github.com/PallaviKatari/React_Route_Guard,2022-05-09,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,290,,"HTML,CSS,JavaScript",JavaScript,,,"javascript,jsx,react18,react-router-dom",,True,4.0
